# Caithness-and-Moray-Firth-Cetacean-Sightings
We have mapped all the Facebook reported sightings from August - December.  Locations are based on estimates from what is reported, therefore the more detail in posts, the more accurate the map point.
The website isnâ€™t perfect but we are limited by free software.  The map is best viewed on a pc browser.  If you are using a mobile phone I recommend tilting the screen landscape.  The sightings can be filtered by month and species.
Shapefiles available on request.
